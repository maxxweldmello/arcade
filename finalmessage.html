    <h1 class="final-title">You Made It To Me ❤️</h1>

    <p class="final-poem">

        You began with LOVE,<br>
        not just as a word… but as a promise.<br><br>

        Through TRUST and PATIENCE,<br>
        through CARE and UNDERSTANDING,<br>
        you proved that FOREVER isn't a dream,<br>
        it’s something we build… step by step.<br><br>

        Every COMMITMENT you honored,<br>
        every PROMISE you kept,<br>
        brought you closer — not just to the top,<br>
        but closer to my heart.<br><br>

        You remembered every name I hold dear —<br>
        DARLING, SWEETHEART, BABY, BABU…<br>
        names that carry warmth,<br>
        names that carry us.<br><br>

        And when FEAR appeared… you didn’t stop.<br>
        When DOUBT whispered… you stood strong.<br>
        When ANXIETY and OVERTHINK tried to hold you back…<br>
        you chose courage.<br><br>

        You refused to feel ALONE.<br>
        You refused to FAIL.<br>
        You chose US.<br><br>

        And now you stand here…<br>
        not because the path was easy,<br>
        but because your heart was brave.<br><br>

        So here I am… waiting.<br>
        Always have been.<br>
        Always will be.<br><br>

        Because with you…<br>
        I found my FOREVER. 💜
