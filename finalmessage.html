    <h1 class="final-title">You Made It To Me ❤️</h1>

   <p class="final-poem">

    You began with LOVE,<br>
    not just as a word… but as a feeling.<br><br>

    Through TRUST and CARE,<br>
    through every SMILE you gave,<br>
    you showed me that LOVE grows stronger,<br>
    day by day, moment by moment.<br><br>

    Every SMILE you shared,<br>
    every moment of CARE,<br>
    brought you closer — not just to the end,<br>
    but closer to my heart.<br><br>

    You remembered every little thing —<br>
    every HUG, every KISS,<br>
    every SMILE that made everything better.<br><br>

    Even when things were not easy,<br>
    you chose LOVE.<br>
    You chose CARE.<br>
    You chose US.<br><br>

    And now you stand here…<br>
    not because the path was perfect,<br>
    but because your heart stayed true.<br><br>

    So here I am… waiting.<br>
    Always have been.<br>
    Always will be.<br><br>

    Because with you…<br>
    I feel HAPPY. 💜

</p>


    <h1 class="final-title">HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY 🫂😘❤️</h1>
